Sugar Factory Performance Dashboard
This repository contains the Power BI solution for a real-time Sugar Factory Performance Dashboard, designed to provide comprehensive operational insights and enhance decision-making in the manufacturing domain. Developed with a focus on data integration, performance optimization, and intuitive visualization, this dashboard empowers stakeholders to monitor key production and logistics metrics effectively.

Project Overview
The Sugar Factory Performance Dashboard addresses critical needs in the sugar manufacturing process by offering a centralized view of vital operational data. It integrates various data points to provide insights into production KPIs, logistics efficiency, and farmer engagement. The dashboard's interactive nature allows users to drill down into specific details, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource allocation.

Key Features
Real-time KPI Monitoring: Tracks essential manufacturing KPIs, including molasses temperature, energy usage, and overall production output (Total Net Weight in Tons).

Logistics & Transportation Analysis: Provides detailed insights into vehicle involvement, transportation distance, and the number of transporters, optimizing the supply chain.

Farmer Management & Payments: Monitors farmer engagement (number of farmers) and farmer payment data, facilitating transparent and efficient financial operations.

Monthly Performance Trends: Visualizes Total Net Weight (Tons) by Month, allowing for easy identification of seasonal trends and performance fluctuations.

Village-wise Performance Breakdown: Breaks down Total Net Weight (Tons) by Village, enabling geographical performance analysis and targeted interventions.

Vehicle Type Analysis: Illustrates the distribution of Total Net Weight (Tons) by Vehicle Type (Truck, Tractor), aiding in fleet management and logistics planning.

Detailed Farmer Performance Table: Presents a comprehensive table of Farmer Name vs. Total Net Weight (Tons), offering granular data on individual farmer contributions.

Interactive Filters: Features a robust "Filter Panel" allowing users to filter data by Village, Month, Farmer Name, and Transporter Name, providing dynamic and customized views.

Data-Driven Bottleneck Identification: Designed to quickly highlight areas of inefficiency, such as low-performing villages or specific transportation issues.

Enhanced Reporting Efficiency: Automates data refresh processes and optimizes filters to significantly reduce reporting time, providing timely insights.

Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop: For data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design.

Power BI Service: For publishing, sharing, and scheduled data refreshes.

Power Query (M Language): For data integration, transformation, and ETL pipelines.

APIs: Utilized for integrating real-time sensor data and other external data sources.

SQL/Oracle (Implied): For database connectivity and data extraction.

Impact & Value
This dashboard has been instrumental in:

Improving operational oversight and control within the sugar factory.

Enabling proactive identification and resolution of production and logistics bottlenecks.

Optimizing resource allocation and enhancing supply chain efficiency.

Facilitating data-driven decision-making for various stakeholders, from operations managers to finance teams.

Reducing manual reporting efforts and providing timely, accurate insights.
